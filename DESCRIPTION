Description: Extensive functions for L-moments (LMs) and probability-weighted moments
  (PWMs), parameter estimation for distributions, LM computation for distributions, and
  L-moment ratio diagrams. Maximum likelihood and maximum product of spacings estimation
  are also available. LMs for right-tail and left-tail censoring by known or unknown
  threshold and by indicator variable are available. Asymmetric (asy) trimmed LMs
  (TL-moments, TLMs) are supported. LMs of residual (resid) and reversed (rev) resid life
  are implemented along with 13 quantile function operators for reliability and survival
  analyses. Exact analytical bootstrap estimates of order statistics, LMs, and variances-
  covariances of LMs are provided. The Harri-Coble Tau34-squared Normality Test is available.
  Distribution support with "L" (LMs), "TL" (TLMs) and added (+) support for right-tail
  censoring (RC) encompasses: Asy Exponential (Exp) Power [L], Asy Triangular [L],
  Cauchy [TL], Eta-Mu [L], Exp. [L], Gamma [L], Generalized (Gen) Exp Poisson [L],
  Gen Extreme Value [L], Gen Lambda [L,TL], Gen Logistic [L), Gen Normal [L],
  Gen Pareto [L+RC, TL], Govindarajulu [L], Gumbel [L], Kappa [L], Kappa-Mu [L],
  Kumaraswamy [L], Laplace [L], Linear Mean Resid. Quantile Function [L], Normal [L],
  3-p log-Normal [L], Pearson Type III [L], Rayleigh [L], Rev-Gumbel [L+RC], Rice/Rician [L],
  Slash [TL], 3-p Student t [L], Truncated Exponential [L], Wakeby [L], and Weibull [L].
  Multivariate sample L-comoments (LCMs) are implemented to measure asymmetric associations.
