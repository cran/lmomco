Version 0.3--January 31, 2006 Initial Release

Version 0.4--February 28, 2006
0. Numerous enhancements to the documentation
1. Bug fix on fourth L-moment of Cauchy distribution in lmomcau()
2. Bug fix on absolute value of TAU5 in are.lmom.valid()
3. Bug fixes on are.pargld.valid().
4. Addition of cdfgld() (stable), lmomgld() (stable), pargld() (highly experimental).
5. Addition of lmomTLgld() (stable) and parTLgld() (highly experimental)
6. Addition of lmomTLgpa() (stable) and parTLgpa() (stable)
7. Addition of vec2TLmom()

Version 0.5--March 12, 2006
1. Total design of pargld() and parTLgld()
2. Adjustments to interface of lmomTLgpa() and parTLgpa() for consistency with
     the GLD distribution.
3. Major additions to freq.curve.all() (addition of plotting options and
     more verbose messaging)
4. Speed up of freq.curve.gld() by addition of paracheck=FALSE to quagld().
5. Internal functions to lmomkap() are now defined internal to the function.
6. check.fs() added.
7. Improvement to output of lmom.test.*() functions.
