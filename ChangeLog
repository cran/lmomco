Version 0.3---January 31, 2006 Initial Release

Version 0.4---February 28, 2006
0. Numerous enhancements to the documentation.
1. Bug fix on fourth L-moment of Cauchy distribution in lmomcau().
2. Bug fix on absolute value of TAU5 in are.lmom.valid().
3. Bug fixes on are.pargld.valid().
4. Addition of cdfgld() (stable), lmomgld() (stable), pargld() (highly experimental).
5. Addition of lmomTLgld() (stable) and parTLgld() (highly experimental).
6. Addition of lmomTLgpa() (stable) and parTLgpa() (stable).
7. Addition of vec2TLmom().

Version 0.5---March 12, 2006
1. Total redesign of pargld() and parTLgld().
2. Adjustments to interface of lmomTLgpa() and parTLgpa() for consistency with
     the GLD distribution.
3. Major additions to freq.curve.all() (addition of plotting options and
     more verbose messaging).
4. Speed up of freq.curve.gld() by addition of paracheck=FALSE to quagld().
5. Internal functions to lmomkap() are now defined internal to the function.
6. check.fs() added.
7. Improvement to output of lmom.test.*() functions.

Version 0.6---March 25, 2006
0. Tweaks and corrections to documentation--learning more about LaTeX too.
1. are.par.valid() could not dispatch to Wakeby distribution--fixed.
2. Extension of TL-moments to asymmetry: trimming in tails can be controlled.
3. Addition of theoLmoms() to compute theoretical L-moments: uses theoTLmoms().
4. Addition of theoTLmoms() to compute theoretical TL-moments using numerical
     integration of the quantile function. A valuable check on par2lmom()
     or the lmomCCC() functions.
5. par2cdf() did not dispatch to Generalized Lambda distribution--fixed.
6. Addition of nowarn toggle to vec2par() {implemented therein}, through 
     are.par.valid() via the ..., and each of the are.parCCC.valid() 
     {implemented therein}. This was done so that parameter optimization 
     algorithms could be build on top of the parameter validation checks and 
     cascading warning messages that the user would not care about can be 
     surpressed.

Version 0.7---April 13, 2006
1. Added full vectorization of the quaCCC() and cdfCCC() functions. Previously
     each function did not handle a vector of nonexceedance probability and 
     quantile values in each respective function.
2. Added extract argument to the pargld() and parTLgld() functions.
3. Incorporated endpoint or range checking on cdfgld().

Version 0.75---April 30, 2006
1. Added lmoms.R, which in reality dispatches to TLmoms, but provides a lower
     case name space and eventually could take the place of lmom.ub().
2. Added additional error trapping to TLmom() and TLmoms().
3. Added the Weibull distribution (wei).
4. Added the random deviate generator rlmomco() given sample size and 
     parameter object. 
5. Added the plotting-position formula by pp().

Version 0.76---May 11, 2006
0a. Further progress on documentation following R-help feedback and my own
      proofreads.
0b. Adding more examples to the documentation.
1. Added par2cdf2() and par2qua2() for combining two quantile functions
     into one through minor abilities to control weight factors.
2. Bug fix on vec2lmom()---function did not retain NULL for undefined
     L-moment (because of sample size) prior to calling are.lmom.valid().
3. Plotting-position formula changed in pp.R and substantial documentation
     added to parallel that in Handbook of Hydrology.
4. Adjusted all parCCC() functions (not including parameter estimation
     using TL-moments) to support either the lmom.ub() or lmoms() L-moment
     objects. The new function lmorph() is used for the object conversion.
5. Added the dist.list() function for convenience.

Version 0.77---May 15, 2006
0. Pertaining to number 1, enhancement to documentation of the Lcomoment
     functions has been made.
1. Bug fix on a single conditional in Lcomoment.coefficients. Function was
     handling a first-order first argument, but crashing on order evaluation
     of the second argument.
     
Version 0.80---June 20, 2006
0. Further tweaks to the documentation.
1. Warning message added when Tau5 missing on call to pargld() and parTLgld().
2. Added support for user supplied initial guess for pargld() and parTLgld().
3. Bug fix on pargev(). The function was broken for Tau3 < -0.80. Bug caused
   during port from Hosking FORTRAN library. Bug was discovered during tests
   of parwei().

Version 0.82--July 13, 2006
0. Further tweaks to the documentation.
1. Word of caution about lack of checking by the function of monotonic 
   increase of par2cdf2() an par2qua2().
2. Added the qua2ci() function for estimation of confidence limits of quantiles
   of a distribution using Monte Carlo simulation.
3. It was possible to call are.lmom.valid() with an object from lmoms()
   without an actual check on the L-moments because length(lmom$L1) == 0 was
   not checked. The function lmorph() is now used to convert prior to
   validation.
4. Added the gen.freq.curves() function for plotting randomly generated
   frequency curves by specifying: sample size, the parent distribution, and
   the number of simulations.
5. Added the genci() function for generation of lists or data.frames of
   confidence intervals for a vector of nonexceedance probabilities, a given
   sample size, and a specified parent using Monte Carlo simulation.
6. Recognized the quaCCC() functions had been extended into the features 
   provided by freq.curve.CCC() functions.  Thus, all freq.curve.CCC()
   functions are removed from the package.
7. Bug fix on F=0||1 probabilities into quape3(). Bug occurred in extension
   of function to handle a vector of probabilities during development of
   version 0.7 of this package.
8. lmompe3() did not compute and hence return L-CV---incomplete port from
   Hosking library. L-CV is returned now.
9. pargam() would return invalid parameters as the specific range of L-moments
   for a valid gamma was not being checked. This was because of an incomplete
   port of Hosking FORTRAN library.

Version 0.83--April 10, 2007
0. Further tweaks to documentation.
1. Added callplot and showsample options to gen.freq.curves().
2. Added plmomco() and qlmomco() as adjuncts to rlmomco() and to better 
   parallel built-in distribution functions of R itself.
3. Bug fix on examples in genci() that manifested as the April 2007
   release of R approached.

Version 0.84--May 2, 2007
1. Bug fix on genci() related to overwriting the sample size by the length
   of the nonexceedance probability vector. Fixed and tested. The function
   was extended to handle the ifail value from qua2ci().
2. Additional warning message added to qua2ci() when the L-moments of the
   simulated sample are not valid---likely a cause of a small sample size and
   a complex (high parameter number distribution), which produces one or more
   giant magnitude numbers for a simulated quantile. Added the ifail and
   ifailtext return elements from the qua2ci() function for better processing
   by the genci() or other calling functions. Also, added the maxlogdiff
   argument to control whether a simulated quantile is actually retained
   before the completion sequence of the function is begun. This argument
   is used to control whether hideously ``out-of-whack,'' which would 
   likely occur for heavy-tailed infinite limit upper tails.
