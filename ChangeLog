Version 0.3---January 31, 2006 Initial Release

Version 0.4---February 28, 2006
0. Numerous enhancements to the documentation
1. Bug fix on fourth L-moment of Cauchy distribution in lmomcau()
2. Bug fix on absolute value of TAU5 in are.lmom.valid()
3. Bug fixes on are.pargld.valid().
4. Addition of cdfgld() (stable), lmomgld() (stable), pargld() (highly experimental).
5. Addition of lmomTLgld() (stable) and parTLgld() (highly experimental)
6. Addition of lmomTLgpa() (stable) and parTLgpa() (stable)
7. Addition of vec2TLmom()

Version 0.5---March 12, 2006
1. Total redesign of pargld() and parTLgld().
2. Adjustments to interface of lmomTLgpa() and parTLgpa() for consistency with
     the GLD distribution.
3. Major additions to freq.curve.all() (addition of plotting options and
     more verbose messaging)
4. Speed up of freq.curve.gld() by addition of paracheck=FALSE to quagld().
5. Internal functions to lmomkap() are now defined internal to the function.
6. check.fs() added.
7. Improvement to output of lmom.test.*() functions.

Version 0.6---March 25, 2006
0. Tweaks and corrections to documentation--learning more about LaTeX too.
1. are.par.valid() could not dispatch to Wakeby distribution--fixed.
2. Extension of TL-moments to asymmetry: trimming in tails can be controlled.
3. Addition of theoLmoms() to compute theoretical L-moments: uses theoTLmoms().
4. Addition of theoTLmoms() to compute theoretical TL-moments using numerical
     integration of the quantile function. A valuable check on par2lmom()
     or the lmomCCC() functions.
5. par2cdf() did not dispatch to Generalized Lambda distribution--fixed.
6. Addition of nowarn toggle to vec2par() {implemented therein}, through 
     are.par.valid() via the ..., and each of the are.parCCC.valid() 
     {implemented therein}. This was done so that parameter optimization 
     algorithms could be build on top of the parameter validation checks and 
     cascading warning messages that the user would not care about can be 
     surpressed.

Version 0.7---April 13, 2006
1. Added full vectorization of the quaCCC.R and cdfCCC.R functions. Previously
     each function did not handle a vector of nonexceedance probability and 
     quantile values in each respective function.
2. Added extract argument to the pargld.R and parTLgld.R functions.
3. Incorporated endpoint or range checking on cdfgld.R.

Version 0.75---April 30, 2006
1. Added lmoms.R, which in reality dispatches to TLmoms, but provides a lower
     case name space and eventually could take the place of lmom.ub.R.
2. Added additional error trapping to TLmom.R and TLmoms.R.
3. Added the Weibull distribution (wei)
4. Added the random deviate generator rlmomco.R given sample size and 
     parameter object. 
5. Added the plotting-position formula by pp.R

Version 0.76---May 11, 2006
0a. Further progress on documentation following R-help feedback and my own
      proofreads.
0b. Adding more examples to the documentation.
1. Added par2cdf2() and par2qua2() for combining two quantile functions
     into one through minor abilities to control weight factors.
2. Bug fix on vec2lmom()---function did not retain NULL for undefined
     L-moment (because of sample size) prior to calling are.lmom.valid().
3. Plotting-position formula changed in pp.R and substantial documentation
     added to parallel that in Handbook of Hydrology.
4. Adjusted all parCCC.R functions (not including parameter estimation
     using TL-moments) to support either the lmom.ub() or lmoms() L-moment
     objects. The new function lmorph() is used for the object conversion.
5. Added the dist.list() function for convenience.

Version 0.77--May 15, 2006
0. Pertaining to number 1, enhancement to documentation of the Lcomoment
     functions has been made.
1. Bug fix on a single conditional in Lcomoment.coefficients. Function was
     handling a first-order first argument, but crashing on order evaluation
     of the second argument.
